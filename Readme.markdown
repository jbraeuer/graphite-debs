This repository holds script to build Debian/Ubuntu packages for (Graphite)[http://graphite.wikidot.com/].

Tested on Ubuntu 12.04. Pull requests welcome.

Run `./package.sh` to generate the packages.

The packages were created with a modified fpm version (0.4.10), where no additional options are passed to setup.py.

Enjoy,
Jens
